## A change of heart

When I first began my journey in coding, I struggled to understand the importance of coding standards. To me, they seemed like a tedious and time-consuming task that added little to no value to the functionality of the code. After every assignment, I would often have to spend countless hours going through and formatting my code, making sure the indentation was correct, adding comments, and placing spaces in the right places. I found this process to be frustrating, as I felt like I was losing precious time that could be spent on more meaningful tasks. 

It wasn’t until I first had a collaborative project with another person, did I see the necessity and the advantages of using code standards. Riddled with bugs and completely unreadable, I found that it was simply faster to redo my partner’s part on my own than to slowly slave away and try to decode and debug their work. It was at that moment that I realized if everyone adhered to a common set of guidelines, instead of their own personal style, we would be able to improve the organization and readability of code, thereby drastically reducing the amount of time spent on debugging. Coding standards exist not for the benefit of any individual, but for the benefit of the coding community as a whole.

Asking questions online can be intimidating for some individuals, as no one wants to be berated or criticized for not knowing something. However, it is important to recognize that asking questions is essential part learning and growth in any field, especially software engineering. As the our field continues to grow and evolve we will inevitably encounter situations in which we are unable to resolve a problem on our own. At such times, it's crucial to be able to ask questions and find answers in an effective manner to overcome these obstacles. Asking "smart" questions not only helps mitigate any harsh backlash from online forums but also  increase you chances of receiving useful feedback in a more timely manner.
