<p>Having just started my journey into the world of programming a little over a year ago, my knowledge regarding JavaScript was at best, surface level. Other than the fact it was one of the core languages of web development I had assumed, just based on the name, JavaScript was similar to Java but with a more complex syntax system. After spending an entire year just to learn Java, you can imagine the intimidation and dread that I felt when we were told that we had to learn JavaScript within a week. However, to my surprise, JavaScript had quite the easy learning curve as the language.</p>

<p>Unlike Java or C/C++, JavaScript’s minimalist nature offers a considerable level of flexibility and dynamicness not seen in the aforementioned languages. This flexibility is most noticeable in how JavaScript handles variable declarations. As a loosely typed language, variables do not need to be strictly declared in advance with the appropriate data type, such as “int,” “bool,” or “string.” Instead, types are automatically assigned to variables during run-time depending on the type of data being fed into them. This feature alone made coding much more fluid and less frustrating. Another example of JavaScript’s flexibility and simplicity can be seen in its special syntax “destructing assignment.” Destructuring assignment is a powerful tool that allows for the extraction and assignment of data from arrays and objects. As this can be done with a single line, it makes coding much more concise and readable. In my opinion, JavaScript’s simplistic and intuitive design offers a considerable level of flexibility and freedom, thereby making it a good language for beginners who are just starting their journey into the world of coding to get their feet wet.</p>

<h2 id="typefit-javascript-gains-with-athletic-software-engineering">TypeFit: Javascript gains with Athletic Software Engineering</h2>

<p>For this semester, I’ve swapped out my usual crossfit routine for a new exercise: hitting the keyboard. Forget about arm and leg day, it’s time for finger and brain day. The term WOD, or workout of the day, comes crossfit and typically involves a series of short, intense workouts that include a variety of functional movements such as weightlifting, gymnastics, and cardiovascular exercises. Our class has taken this concept and has modified the WODs in such a way that students are expected to exercise one or more computer skills in an effective and efficient manner. Honestly, when I heard that WODs were graded based on time I had a mild panic attack because a major weakness of mine is being able to quickly and efficiently produce working code under a time limit. However, after this first week of WODs, I found that, while stressful, the WODs were an excellent opportunity to test my current level of comprehension and allowed me to solidify and put into practice the knowledge that I learned at FreeCodeCamp.</p>

<p>My overall impression of the WODs and ASE is that, quite similar to a professional athlete’s workout, it offers us students the opportunity to gain competency in our software engineering skills through a high intensity and time-constrained workout routine. By forcing us to put more time and effort into learning and practicing the material, we are able to gain the skills and habits necessary to survive in the real world and successively undergo similar challenges like technical interviews.</p>
